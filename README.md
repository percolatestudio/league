## League

League is a team management app written in meteor.

### Install

To install, download the source code, and the [meteorite](http://oortcloud.github.com/meteorite/) development tool.

You'll also need to compile the CSS (it's SCSS, which isn't well supported by JS), using an external app, such as [Scout](http://mhs.github.com/scout-app/). Make sure the style.css file is created within the client directory.

### Running

Simply run `mrt` in the league directory. Alternatively, you can visit the live beta site at http://getleague.com.
